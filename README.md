<h1>Dangerous Drug Preventing System</h1>

In Sri Lanka usage of dangerous drug is increasing rapidly day by day. Government has taken many steps on preventing dangerous from country. But all the efforts are giving a very less amount in success. Most of the drug dealers are now targeting the school children. So, our country’s future generation is now facing a great threat to their lives. Researchers have recently identified that “Without the help of the people of the country none of the steps were going to end up in success”. And they have also stated that “Many people in our country are ready to help in this good work but they were not trying to come forward because they are scared of the drug dealers. So, National Dangerous Drugs Control Board has decided to develop a software through which people can anonymously take part in preventing the drugs from our country, by filing a complaint through the software about the known drug dealers & drug users. From these complains government can take steps on noted vulnerable persons.
